Assume that we have led them to the proper environment

II. Hello World!

To publish your first webpage, open up the file with this
address, and type (link to pyth hard way) the
following code:

    ;html
      ;head
        ;title: Hello
      ==
      ;body: Helo web.
    ==

Now, direct your web browser to this URL: *****.

Congratulations, you have just rendered a webpage using Sail (link to reference), hoon's
markdown syntax. 

II. Sail

This page is produced by an html node consisting of two subnodes,
the first for the head and second for the body. The hoon
structure for an XML node is called a `manx`(link), which is
opened with a `;`, followed by the tag, and is closed by a `==`
aligned directly beneath the `;`. Any subnodes are included
in between, and are indented by two spaces.

The method employed above for including character data within a
`manx` consists of appending a `:` to the end
of the tag. In this construct, the `manx` is closed soley with a
new line.

The `manx` produced by the code above, as well as the html
that it renders are shown below:

    [ [%html ~]
      [[%head ~] [[%title ~] [[%~. [%~. "Hello"] ~] ~] ~] ~]
      [[%body ~] [[%~. [%~. "Helo web."] ~] ~] ~]
      ~
    ]

    "<html><head><title>Hello</title></head><body>Helo web.</body></html>"

To include attributes(link), append within parentheses the attribute name followed
by the value within quotations:

    ;html
      ;head
        ;title: Hello
      ==
      ;body
        ;h1: Helo web, this is a heading!
        ;p(style "color: blue"): This is a paragraph with a style attribute.
        ;a(href "http://www.example.com/"): This works for links too!
      ==
    ==

Once you've made sure it renders, try tweaking it to include
other attributes.

To interpolate native hoon expressions (link) into sail,
insert the expression between a pair of `{}`.
Type the example below and render it in the browser to view
the evalution of this hoon expression: `?:((gth 2 1) "o" "0")}`

    ;html
      ;head
        ;title: Hello
      ==
      ;body: Helo web.
        ;h1: This is a heading
        ;p: "Paragraph with interp{?:((gth 2 1) "ol" "false")}ated text"
    ==

III. Twigs

As shown, the result is the char 'o', which is 
interpolated into the character data of the paragraph node, which
is then rendered as html and served to your browser.

The expression `?:((gth 2 1) "o" "0")}`, like all other
expressions in hoon, compiles down to an Abstract Syntax
Tree(link), which in hoon is called a `twig`(link). Twigs are
constructed using symbols called runes(link).


glyphs->runes

In this expression, two contiguous glyphs(link) `?`, and `:`,
pronounced `wut` and `col` respectively, to form a rune.
Proficient C programmers will notice the similarity between
`wutcol` amd C's if-then-else statement, which is precisely what
wutcol is. 

When parsed, an expression framed with `?:` generates the twig:

    [%wtcl p=twig q=twig r=twig]                ::  if p, then q, else r

As you can see, the twig %wtcl requires three twigs:

1.The first must be a twig that evaluates to a boolean (loobean,
link). In this case, it is the expression (gth 2 1), which is
parsed to the twig cenhep:

    [%cnhp p=twig q=tusk]                       ::  slam p w/ sample q

cenhep takes a twig `p` that accepts an argument (called a
`sample` in hoon link) of a list of one or
more twigs q called a `tusk`(link). In this case, p is
represented by the function(arm) `++gth`, which compiles down to
the synthetic twig(link) cenzaz:

    [%cnzz p=wing]                              ::  pulls p

cnzz is used to match the name `gth` with the associated axis
address (link) to retrieve the source code of the `gth` function
from the context:

    [%cnzz p=wing]                              ::  pulls p
    [%$ p=axis]                                 ::  simple leg

**Here the second twig is %$(the empty name), which consists of
an address of the code to be loaded

The `tusk`(list of twigs) gth accepts here are the constants 2 and 1, 
which both compile to the synthetic twig dotzey(link), which
produces an atomic constant(link) of type p and value q:

    [%dtzy p=term q=@]                          ::  atom constant

**A term(link) is just a string used as a type identifier

Here, cenhep--gth called (slammed in hoon, link) with the
constants 2 and 1--produces true, or `%.y` in hoon.

2-3. The latter two twigs required by %wtcl are strings, called
"tapes"(link) "ol" and "0", which also parses to %dtzy. As the first
twig of %wtcl evaluates to %.y, the second twig, dtzy, with the
value "o" is evaluated, producing the character "o", which is
interpolated into the sail char data that is then rendered as
html.
