Overview
--------

There are two categories of `~` runes, which are used to provide
information at runtime. You can think of them as hints to the
interpreter.

For Printing:

[`~&`]() Prints to the console. [`~!`]() Prints the type of a [twig]()
if compilation fails.

For [jetting]():

[`~>`]() The natural `~` rune. Implements Nock 10, applying an arbitrary
[`++arm]() hint`p`to`q`. [`~/`]()  Attaches a formula-level jet hint.  [`~%\`]()
Attaches a core-level jet hint.
