[cenhep, `%-`, %cnhp](#cnhp)
============================

Slam, n-arguments

`%-` is a synthetic rune that that [pull]()s [`$`]() from the [door]()
`p` with its sample set to `[%cltr q]`. `%-` in both its tall and wide
forms is like a function call with one argument. However, `%-`is most
commonly used in its irregular form, where `p` and `q` are enclosed within `()` where `q` is a list of n arguments.
