Overview
--------

The `?` runes, with the exception of `?=`, produce conditional
statements. The `?` runes are the workhorse of control-flow.

There are three basic categories:

If-then-else statements:

[`?:`]() A natural `?` rune. The traditional if-than-else statement.
[`?.`]() Inversion of `?:`. An "unless" statement. Used to keep the code
flowing vertically.

Switches:

[`?-`]() Tradional switch. [`?+`]() Switch with a default return value.

Type Tests:

[`?=`]() Tests if the [icon]() of [`++tile`]() `p` contains `q`.
