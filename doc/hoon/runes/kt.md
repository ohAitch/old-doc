Overview
--------

The `^` runes perform type operations. With the exception of `^-` and
`^.`, they are all natural runes.

There are three basic categories of `^` runes:

Those that cast values to specific types:

[`^-`]() Casts `q` to the type of the [bunt]() of `p`. [`^+`]() Casts
`q` to the type of `p`.

Those that change the [variance]() of [cores]():

[`^|`]() Converts core from [%gold]() to [%iron](). [`^&`]() Converts
core from [%gold]() to [%zinc](). [`^?`]() Converts core from [%gold]()
to [%lead]().

Those that add a variable name:

[`^=`]() Changes the type of a value by adding a [`++face`]().
