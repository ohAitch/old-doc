# Nock

<div class="short">

Nock is a homoiconic combinator algebra, not much fancier than SKI combinators.
The spec fits on a T-shirt and gzips to 340 bytes. 

Think of Nock as a kind of functional assembly language. It's not like assembly
language in that it's directly executed by the hardware. It is like assembly
language in that:

- Everything in Urbit executes as Nock.
- You wouldn't want to program directly in Nock.
- Learning to program directly in Nock is a great way to start understanding Urbit from the ground up.

Just as Unix runs C programs by compiling them to assembler, Urbit runs Hoon
programs by compiling them to Nock. You could try to learn Hoon without learning Nock. But just as C is a thin wrapper over the physical CPU, Hoon is a thin wrapper over the Nock virtual machine. It's a tall stack made of thin layers, which is much easier to learn a layer at a time.

And unlike most fundamental theories of computing, there's really nothing smart
or interesting about Nock. Of course, in a strictly formal sense, all of
computing is math. But that doesn't mean it needs to feel like math. Nock is a
simple mechanical device and it's meant to feel that way.
