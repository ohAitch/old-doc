##Overview

The `%` runes [pull]() [`++arms`]() and [`++wings`]() from the [subject](), often modifying their values.

The `%` runes can be split into two classes. The first pulls data from the subject with changes. The second class specifically pulls the empty arm `$`, which is similar to calling a function.

The natural `%` rune `%=` `[%cnts p=wing q=tram]`, which evaluates `p` with the changes specified in `q`, is the most prominent member of the first class.

Notable `%` runes:

-`%_` evaluates `p` with the changes specified in `q`, then casts the product back to the type of `p`.

-`%*` evaluates the wing `p` from a [door]() `q` with changes `r`, and is terminated by `==`. 

Slamming runes:

-`%-` slams a core with one argument.

-`%+` slams a core with two arguments

-`%^` slams a core with three arguments.
