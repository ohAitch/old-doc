##Overview

The `%` runes [pull]() [`++arms`]() and [`++wings`]() from the [subject](), often modifying their values.

There are two categories of `%` runes: 

One that pulls data from the subject with changes:

##[`%=`]()  Natural `%` rune. Evaluates `p` with the changes specified in `q`.
##[`%_`]()  Evaluates `p` with the changes specified in `q`, then casts the product back to the type of `p`.
##[`%*`]() Evaluates `p` from a [door]() `q` with changes `r`.Terminated by `==`. 

One that specifically pulls the empty arm `$`, which is similar to calling a function:

##[`%-`]() [slams]() a core with one argument.
##[`%+`]() slams a core with two arguments.
##[`%^`]() slams a core with three arguments.
