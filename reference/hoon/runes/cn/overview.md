##Overview

The `%` runes [pull]() [`++arms`]() and [`++wings`]() from the [subject](), often modifying their values. You can think of them kind of like....

There are two categories of `%` runes: 

Those that pull data from the subject with changes:

[`%=`]()  The natural `%` rune. Evaluates `p` with the changes specified in `q`.
[`%_`]()  Evaluates `p` with the changes specified in `q`, then casts the product back to the type of `p`.
[`%*`]()  Evaluates `p` from a [door]() `q` with changes `r`.Terminated by `==`. 

Those that specifically pull the empty arm `$`, similar to calling a function:

[`%-`]() [slams]() a core with one argument.
[`%+`]() slams a core with two arguments.
[`%^`]() slams a core with three arguments.
