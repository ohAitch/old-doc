#[cencol, `%:`, %cncl](#cncl)

Slam, one argument

`%:` is a synthetic rune that that [pull]()s [`$`]() from the [door]() `p` with its sample set to `q`. `%:` in the most common case simply [slam]()s `p` with `q`, similar to a function call with one argument. Unlike its close relative `%-`, `%:` is designed for [gate]()s who take a single value as their sample.

##Produces
