#bucpam `$&` %bcpm

[Short description]

`$&`, `bucpam`, is a tile rune that produces a `%bush`, a tile whose [icon]() is a [fork]() between two different kinds of nouns: cells whose head is a cell and cells whose head is an atom `(tile q)`. Its default value is the value of `q`. One fundamental use of `$&` is to implement autocons in [`++twig`]() and [`++tile`]().

##Produces

[Tile](): `[%bush p=tile q=tile]`

`p` is a [tile]().

##Tall form

$&  p
        q
    ==

##Wide form

$&(p q)

##Irregular form

None

##Examples

We don't have to look very far to find a bush - ++tile is one, as is ++twig and ++nock. The rune is $& (bucpam). See ++tile above - p is [p=tile q=tile], q is the $%.
