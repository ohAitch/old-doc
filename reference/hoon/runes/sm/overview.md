##Overview

The `;` runes are used for composition. They are all synthetic.

-`;:` applies a binary gate to multiple arguments.

-`;~` uses a monad to compose multiple gates, producing a gate of a similar type.

-`;;` composes a [clam]() with a value, slamming the value through the clam and forcefully verifying that it is unchanged. See also: [`++hard`]().

-`;"` composes [`++tapes`]() and twigs that produce `++tape`s. Generally used in its irregular form, of [text surrounded by double quotes](string interpolation).

-`;-`, `;+`, `;*`, `;%`, and `%cnzy` all compose a tree structure. See also: [`++sail`]().
