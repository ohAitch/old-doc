##Overview

The `=` runes modify the subject. They are used whenever you want to push something on the subject, or use the results of one formula in another.

The natural `=` rune is `=>`, `[%tsgr p=twig q=twig]`, which uses the product of `p` as the subject for the formula `q`.

Other notable `=` runes:

`=<`, an inversion of `=>`, which uses the product of `q` as the subject for the formula `a`. Used to make code more readable by making it flow vertically.

`=+` pushes data and code on the subject.

`=.` changes data in the subject.
