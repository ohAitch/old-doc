##Overview
There are two categories of `~` runes, which are used to provide information at runtime:

For Printing:
##[`~&`]()  Prints to the console.
##[`~!`]()  Prints the type of a [twig]() if compilation fails.

For [jetting]()

##[`~>`]()  The natural `~` rune. Implements Nock 10, applying an arbitrary [`++arm]() hint `p` to `q`.
##[`~/`]()  Attaches a formula-level jet hint. 
##[`~%`]()  Attaches a core-level jet hint.
