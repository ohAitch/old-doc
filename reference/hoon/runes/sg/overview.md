##Overview
The `~` runes provide runtime hints. The natural `~` rune is `~>`, which implements Nock 10, applying an arbitrary hint `p` to `q`.

Other notable `~` runes:

-`~&` prints to the console.

-`~!` prints the type of a twig if compilation fails.

-`~/` attaches a formula-level jet hint. 

-`~%` marks a core-level jet hint.
