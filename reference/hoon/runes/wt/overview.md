##Overview

The `?` runes, with the exception of `?=`, produce conditional statements.

There are two natural `?` runes: `?:`, which is an if-than-else statement; and `?=`, which tests if the [icon]() of `++tile` `p` contains `q`.

Other notable `-` runes:

-`?.` produces an inverted if-than-else statement. Used to keep the code flowing vertically.

-`?-`, produces a switch.

-`?+`, produces a switch with a default return value.

-`?~`, produces an if-than-else expression that tests whether the predicate is null.
