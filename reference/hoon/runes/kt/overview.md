##Overview

The `^` runes perform type operations.

There are three basic categories of `^` runes:

Ones that cast values to specific types:

##[`^-`]()  Casts `q` to the type of the [bunt]()  of `p`.
##[`^+`]()  Casts `q` to the type of `p`.

Ones that change the [variance]() of [cores]():

##[`^|`]()  Converts core from [%gold]() to [%iron]().
##[`^&`]()  Converts core from [%gold]() to [%zinc]().
##[`^?`]()  Converts core from [%gold]() to [%lead]().

One that adds a variable name:

##[`^=`]()  Changes the type of a value by adding a [`++face`]().
